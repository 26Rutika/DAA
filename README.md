Assignment 1:<br>
Problem Statement:<br> 
Given an Array of 1s and 0s which as all 1s followed by all 0s. Find the number of 0s. <br>
Count the number of zeroes in the given array.<br>
<b>Input</b> arr[]={1,1,1,1,0,0}
<b>Output</b>:2
<br>
<b>Output<b><br>
Enter the size of array6<br>

Enter the array elements1<br>
1
1
1
0
0<br>
Number of zero's is:2<br>
<p>To slove these problem we have use divide and conquer strategy.In which we have use <b>Binary Search</b></p>
<p>First simple approach which I used to slove these problem was simple count varibale with for loop code which I do for it is given below </p><br>

Assignment 1:3 statement<br>
Problem Statement:<br>
Given a number n.The task is to find the smallest number whose factorial contain at least n trailing zeroes.<br>
So to slove these problem we will understand what is trailing zeros.<br>
Trailing zeros:Trailing zeros are a sequence of 0 in any positive representation of a number,after which no other digits follow.<br>
For example:<br>
Input: n = 5<br>
Output: 1 <br>
Factorial of 5 is 120 which has one trailing 0.<br>
Input: n = 20<br>
Output: 4<br>
Factorial of 20 is 2432902008176640000 which has<br>
4 trailing zeroes.<br>
